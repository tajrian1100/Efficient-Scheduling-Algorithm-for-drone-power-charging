# Efficient-Scheduling-Algorithm-for-drone-power-charging
This is one of my publications.


Abstract: Drones are opening new horizon as a major Internet-of-Things (IoT) player which is a network of objects. Drone needs to
charge itself during providing services from the charging stations. If there are lots of drones and one charging station, then it is a critical
situation to decide which drone should get charged first and make order of priorities for drones to get charged sequentially. In this
paper, we propose an efficient scheduling algorithm for drone power charging (ESADPC), in which charging station would have a
scheduler to decide which drone can get charged earlier among many other drones. Simulation results have showed that our algorithm
reduces the deadline miss ration and turnaround time.
